		<h2>Origin and Spread</h2>
		<p>This problematic virus' first appearance was 1976 when two simultaneous outbreaks
		occurred. One in South Sudan, the other in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The
		outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo happened near the Ebola River, which
		is where the illness got it's name. It is believed that Ebola was introduced
		by fruit bats, but there is no concrete evidence. There are many ways to spread the
		disease, that's how so many people got it. It could be spread through touching infected
		animals (when preparing, cooking, or eating them); when touching body fluids of infected
		people (like saliva, urine, faeces, or semen); when touching things that would have the
		body fluids of an infected person (clothes or sheets); or when Ebola enters through cuts
		in the skin; or when touching someone's eyes, nose, or mouth. However, it could not be
		spread through the air, water, or food. 80-90% of people who were infected died, so more
		than 11,000 people died!</p>

		<div class="card-body">
			<p>Many people who had "died" from Ebola virus disease, while they were being buried, they moved,
			an obvious sign they were alive. Although they looked like they would die again within a few 
			hours and some people only awoke for a second, then died again. This is because their body would
			go into such a deep coma, that they could be declared "dead", then when they were being buried, their
			body would have sudden jolt of energy, awake form their coma, and some survived and were rushed to
			hospital, for others, the jolt of energy was too much for their bodies, and they died with seconds
			of awaking.</p>
