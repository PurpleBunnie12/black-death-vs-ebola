		<h2>Origin and Spread</h2>
		<p>The origin of the deathly plague, that took the lives of many, was in China in
		the early to mid 1300s. It started with a bacterium called <i>Yersinia pestis</i>
		which then infected fleas that lived on rats, leading to the many thousands of
		people being infected and dying. These infected rats mostly lived on trade
		boats. This was how the plague spread so quickly.
		<br>
		<br>
		In October 1347 the plague hit Europe, after 12 trade ships made their way across
		the Black Sea and reached a port in Sicily. In 5 years, more than 20 million people
		died!</p>
		
		<h2>Causes and Symptoms</h2>
		<p>The cause of the Black Death was <i>Yersinia pestis</i>. This bacterium was 
		spread through the air, through the bite of fleas and rats, and touch. People could
		go to sleep healthy, and be dead by morning.
		<br>
		<br>There were many symptoms including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strange swellings</li>
			<li>Boils with pus and blood seeping out</li>
			<li>Fever</li>
			<li>Chills</li>
			<li>Vomiting</li>
			<li>Diarrhoea</li>
			<li>Aches and pains</li>
			<li>Then death</li>
		</ul>

			<p>Recent research shows that the organism that causes the Black Death, 
			<i>Yersinia pestis</i>, may have existed in Europe as early as 3000BC!</p>

		<h2>People's Response</h2>
		<p>People believed the Black Death was God's punishment because they didn't understand
		the biology of the plague. Therefore, many people tried to win God's forgiveness, to aviod
		getting the plague. Many Jews were murdered between 1348-1349, due to this misunderstanding.
		It was a worrying time for all. To cope with the stress, some people lashed out at their neighbours.
		While others were anxious about the condition of their soul and children, so they locked themselves
		inside as a result.</p>
